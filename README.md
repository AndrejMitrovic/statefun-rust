# Statefun Rust SDK

An SDK for writing stateful functions in Rust. See the [Apache Flink Stateful
Functions](https://flink.apache.org/stateful-functions.html) website for more
information about the project.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/statefun) to learn how to
use this. There is a complete example available in `statefun-greeter-example` along
with another `README.md`.

## Building

You need to have the Protobuf compiler `protoc` available in your `$PATH`. On
macOS you can install this via

```
brew install protobuf
```

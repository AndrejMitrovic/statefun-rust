# Statefun Rust SDK

An SDK for writing stateful functions in Rust. See the [Apache Flink Stateful
Functions](https://flink.apache.org/stateful-functions.html) website for more
information about the project.

At the moment this project is very bare-bones. I'm just getting started and
there's no documentation and tests yet.
